# ChristmasTreeShop
An example of transferring a static site to Word Press and setting up the ability to edit site content from the Word Press admin panel.

The site has the ability to edit all textual information and pictures. Some features of the JS are also implemented. Added modal windows created using a special handler. The first modal window thanks the user for entering a phone number. The second modal window displays product information after selection.
